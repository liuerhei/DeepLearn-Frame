# DeepLearn-Frame
This is a 2D depth learning framework by using cuDNN. It will contain the convolution layer, pool layer, activation layer, the whole connection layer, etc., can achieve forward and backward computing
Now the code just has convolution forward, I will still complete it.   --2017-7-28

Now the code support convolution and pooling forward, and the result is right. And also the code support convolution backward.           --2017-07-31

Up to now, the frame support convolution, pooling, activation OP. And also support backward of convolution and pooling.
The next need to do is add bias in convolution.                                                                                          --2017-08-02
